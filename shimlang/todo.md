    - Sorting
        - sort
        - sorted
        - Kind of needs anonymous functions even if not full closures?
    - reverse
    - reversed
- Dict methods

    - Iter keys
    - Iter keys+values

- Tuple unpacking
- Anonymous functions (non-closures?)
- Native range type
- String methods
- `*args`, and `**kwargs`
- Numeric literals with underscores

    - It can be the type id (which gives us the size), followed by that number of bytes
