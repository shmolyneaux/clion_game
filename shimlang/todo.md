- Custom hashing?
    - Fairly big bump in complexity, with potentially limited usefullness for a game
    - Need to be able to call the `hash` method on a struct from the `get` method of the dict
    - Currently scripts can call into native code, but native code can't call into scripts,
      which seems like a prereq
- String methods
- `*args`, and `**kwargs`
- Numeric literals with underscores
- Format strings
- Integer division
- Closures
- Operator overloading
- Type annotations
- Runtime type checking
- Static type checking
- Remove use of `Vec` for strings
- Remove use of `Vec` for dicts
- Remove use of Box for native values
    - It can be the type id (which gives us the size), followed by that number of bytes
- Ref-counting in MMU
- Debugger
- Memory viewer
- Assemby viewer
- Stack viewer
- Spans for statements
- Garbage collection
- Adding ident cache to Fn bytecode
