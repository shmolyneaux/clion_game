# Shimlang Language Reference

Shimlang is a dynamically-typed scripting language designed for the SHIM game
engine. It features a clean syntax, first-class functions with closures, structs
with methods, and a growing standard library of built-in types and functions.

> **Note:** Shimlang is under active development. This document describes the
> current state of the language as it exists today.

## Hello, World!

The simplest Shimlang program prints a message to the console using the built-in
`print` function:

```rust
print("Hello, World!");
```

Output:

```
Hello, World!
```

`print` accepts multiple arguments separated by commas, which are printed
space-separated:

```rust
print("The answer is", 42);
```

Output:

```
The answer is 42
```

## Variables

Variables are declared with `let` and can hold any type. Reassignment uses `=`
without the `let` keyword:

```rust
let greeting = "Hello";
let year = 2024;
print(greeting, year);

let x = 10;
x = 20;
print(x);
```

Output:

```
Hello 2024
20
```

## Data Types

### Integers

Integers are 32-bit signed values. They support standard arithmetic operations:

```rust
let a = 42;
let b = -7;
print(a);
print(b);
print(a + b);
```

Output:

```
42
-7
35
```

### Floats

Floating-point numbers are 32-bit (single precision). A number with a decimal
point is treated as a float:

```rust
let pi = 3.14;
let neg = -2.5;
print(pi);
print(neg);
```

Output:

```
3.14
-2.5
```

Integer division truncates toward zero. Use floats for decimal results:

```rust
print(10 / 3);
print(10.0 / 3.0);
```

Output:

```
3
3.3333333
```

### Booleans

The two boolean literals are `true` and `false`:

```rust
print(true);
print(false);
```

Output:

```
true
false
```

### Strings

Strings are created with double quotes. They support indexing, length, escape
sequences, and concatenation with `+`:

```rust
let name = "Shimlang";
print(name);
print(name.len());
print(name[0]);
print("Hello" + " " + "World");
```

Output:

```
Shimlang
8
S
Hello World
```

Supported escape sequences include `\n` (newline), `\t` (tab), `\"` (double
quote), and `\\` (backslash):

```rust
print("line one\nline two");
print("a \"quoted\" word");
```

Output:

```
line one
line two
a "quoted" word
```

Strings can be compared for equality:

```rust
let a = "test";
let b = "test";
let c = "other";
print(a == b);
print(a == c);
```

Output:

```
true
false
```

### None

`None` represents the absence of a value. Functions that do not explicitly
return a value return `None`:

```rust
let x = None;
print(x);
```

Output:

```
None
```

### Lists

Lists are ordered, mutable collections that can hold values of any type:

```rust
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
print(numbers);
print(numbers[0]);
print(numbers[-1]);
print(numbers.len());
```

Output:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
1
5
5
```

Negative indices count from the end of the list. List elements can be reassigned
by index:

```rust
let lst = ["a", "b", "c"];
lst[0] = "x";
lst[-1] = "z";
print(lst);
```

Output:

```
[x, b, z]
```

Lists have a rich set of methods:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `.len()` | Returns the number of elements |
| `.append(val)` | Adds an element to the end |
| `.pop()` | Removes and returns the last element |
| `.pop(idx)` | Removes and returns the element at `idx` |
| `.insert(idx, val)` | Inserts `val` before position `idx` |
| `.extend(iterable)` | Appends all elements from an iterable |
| `.clear()` | Removes all elements |
| `.index(val)` | Returns the index of `val`, or `None` |
| `.index(val, default)` | Returns the index of `val`, or `default` |
| `.sort()` | Sorts the list in place |
| `.sort(key_fn)` | Sorts in place using a key function |
| `.sorted()` | Returns a new sorted list |
| `.reverse()` | Reverses the list in place |
| `.reversed()` | Returns a new reversed list |
| `.map(fn)` | Returns a new list with `fn` applied to each element |
| `.filter(fn)` | Returns a new list of elements where `fn` returns truthy |

Examples:

```rust
let lst = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5];
lst.append(9);
print(lst);

lst.sort();
print(lst);

let doubled = lst.map(fn(x) { x * 2 });
print(doubled);

let big = lst.filter(fn(x) { x > 3 });
print(big);
```

Output:

```
[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
[1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]
[2, 2, 6, 8, 10, 18]
[4, 5, 9]
```

The `sorted()` method returns a copy without modifying the original:

```rust
let lst = [5, 2, 8, 1];
let sorted_copy = lst.sorted();
print(lst);
print(sorted_copy);
```

Output:

```
[5, 2, 8, 1]
[1, 2, 5, 8]
```

The `sort` method accepts an optional key function:

```rust
let lst = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3];
lst.sort(fn(x) { 0 - x });
print(lst);
```

Output:

```
[9, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1]
```

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries are hash maps created with the `dict()` built-in. Keys can be
strings or integers:

```rust
let d = dict();
d["name"] = "Alice";
d["age"] = 30;
print(d["name"]);
print(d["age"]);
print(d.len());
```

Output:

```
Alice
30
2
```

You can also use the `.set()` and `.get()` methods:

```rust
let d = dict();
d.set("key", "value");
print(d.get("key"));
```

Output:

```
value
```

Dictionary methods:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `.len()` | Returns the number of entries |
| `.get(key)` | Returns the value for `key` |
| `.set(key, val)` | Sets `key` to `val` |
| `.has(key)` | Returns `true` if `key` exists |
| `.pop(key)` | Removes `key` and returns its value |
| `.pop(key, default)` | Removes `key` or returns `default` |
| `.keys()` | Returns an iterator over keys |
| `.values()` | Returns an iterator over values |
| `.items()` | Returns an iterator over entries with `.key` and `.value` |

Iterating over a dictionary yields its keys. Use `.items()` for key-value pairs:

```rust
let d = dict();
d["a"] = 1;
d["b"] = 2;
d["c"] = 3;

for key in d {
    print(key);
}

for item in d.items() {
    print(item.key, "=>", item.value);
}
```

Output:

```
a
b
c
a => 1
b => 2
c => 3
```

## Operators

### Arithmetic

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `+` | Addition (also string concatenation) |
| `-` | Subtraction |
| `*` | Multiplication |
| `/` | Division (integer division truncates) |
| `%` | Modulus |

```rust
print(10 + 3);
print(10 - 3);
print(10 * 3);
print(10 / 3);
print(10 % 3);
```

Output:

```
13
7
30
3
1
```

### Comparison

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `==` | Equal to |
| `<` | Less than |
| `>` | Greater than |
| `<=` | Less than or equal |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal |

```rust
print(1 < 2);
print(2 > 1);
print(1 <= 1);
print(1 >= 2);
print(1 == 1);
```

Output:

```
true
true
true
false
true
```

### Logical

The `and` and `or` operators use short-circuit evaluation. They return the value
that determined the result, not necessarily `true` or `false`:

```rust
let a = true and false;
print(a);

let b = true or false;
print(b);

let c = false or "fallback";
print(c);
```

Output:

```
false
true
fallback
```

Because of short-circuiting, the right-hand side is not evaluated when the
result is already determined:

```rust
print(false and panic("not reached"));
print(true or panic("not reached"));
```

Output:

```
false
true
```

### Negation

The `!` operator negates a boolean value:

```rust
let a = !true;
print(a);
```

Output:

```
false
```

### Range

The `..` operator creates a range. The `Range()` built-in provides more control
including custom step values:

```rust
for i in 0..5 {
    print(i);
}
```

Output:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

Ranges exclude the upper bound. The `Range()` built-in supports a `.step()`
method for custom increments:

```rust
for i in Range(0, 10).step(3) {
    print(i);
}
```

Output:

```
0
3
6
9
```

Negative steps count downward:

```rust
for i in Range(5, 0).step(-1) {
    print(i);
}
```

Output:

```
5
4
3
2
1
```

## Control Flow

### If / Else

Conditionals use `if` and `else` with curly braces:

```rust
let x = 10;
if x > 5 {
    print("big");
} else {
    print("small");
}
```

Output:

```
big
```

`if`/`else` can also be used as an expression (see
[Block Expressions](#block-expressions)).

### While Loops

```rust
let i = 0;
while i < 3 {
    print(i);
    i = i + 1;
}
```

Output:

```
0
1
2
```

### For Loops

`for` loops iterate over any iterable value — lists, ranges, dictionary
keys, and custom iterators:

```rust
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
for fruit in fruits {
    print(fruit);
}
```

Output:

```
apple
banana
cherry
```

```rust
for i in 0..5 {
    print(i);
}
```

Output:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

### Break and Continue

`break` exits a loop early. `continue` skips to the next iteration:

```rust
let i = 0;
while true {
    if i == 2 {
        i = i + 1;
        continue;
    }
    if i == 4 {
        break;
    }
    print(i);
    i = i + 1;
}
```

Output:

```
0
1
3
```

## Functions

### Defining Functions

Functions are defined with the `fn` keyword:

```rust
fn add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
print(add(3, 4));
```

Output:

```
7
```

### Implicit Return

The last expression in a function body is its return value when no explicit
`return` statement is used:

```rust
fn double(x) {
    x * 2
}
print(double(5));
```

Output:

```
10
```

### Default Arguments

Parameters can have default values. Default expressions are evaluated each time
the function is called with that argument omitted:

```rust
fn greet(name="World") {
    print("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
greet();
greet("Alice");
```

Output:

```
Hello, World!
Hello, Alice!
```

### Keyword Arguments

Arguments can be passed by name, allowing you to skip positional order:

```rust
fn describe(name, age, city) {
    print(name, "is", age, "from", city);
}
describe("Alice", "NYC", age=30);
```

Output:

```
Alice is 30 from NYC
```

### Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions are created with `fn` without a name. They are commonly used
as callbacks:

```rust
let square = fn(x) { x * x };
print(square(5));
```

Output:

```
25
```

### Closures

Functions capture variables from their enclosing scope, forming closures:

```rust
fn make_counter(start) {
    let count = start;
    fn increment() {
        count = count + 1;
        count
    }
    increment
}

let counter = make_counter(0);
print(counter());
print(counter());
print(counter());
```

Output:

```
1
2
3
```

Closures work with anonymous functions as well:

```rust
fn make_adder(n) {
    let adder = fn(val) { n + val };
    adder
}

let add_5 = make_adder(5);
let add_10 = make_adder(10);
print(add_5(3));
print(add_10(3));
```

Output:

```
8
13
```

## Structs

### Defining Structs

Structs group named fields together. Instances are created by calling the struct
name as a constructor:

```rust
struct Point {
    x,
    y
}

let p = Point(1, 2);
print(p.x, p.y);
```

Output:

```
1 2
```

Structs print with a readable representation:

```rust
struct Color {
    r, g, b
}
let c = Color(255, 128, 0);
print(c);
```

Output:

```
Color(r=255, g=128, b=0)
```

### Methods

Methods are defined inside the struct body and take `self` as the first
parameter:

```rust
struct Point {
    x,
    y

    fn add(self, other) {
        Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
    }
}

let a = Point(1, 2);
let b = Point(3, 4);
let c = a.add(b);
print(c.x, c.y);
```

Output:

```
4 6
```

Field values can be updated through `self`:

```rust
struct Point {
    x, y
}

let p = Point(2, 3);
p.x = p.x + 1;
print(p.x);
```

Output:

```
3
```

### Static Methods

Methods without a `self` parameter are static methods, called on the struct
itself rather than an instance:

```rust
struct Point {
    x, y

    fn origin() {
        Point(0, 0)
    }
}

let p = Point.origin();
print(p.x, p.y);
```

Output:

```
0 0
```

### Default Field Values

Struct fields can have default values, including computed expressions:

```rust
struct Config {
    debug = false,
    verbose = false
}

let cfg = Config();
print(cfg.debug, cfg.verbose);

let cfg2 = Config(debug=true);
print(cfg2.debug, cfg2.verbose);
```

Output:

```
false false
true false
```

### Operator Overloading

Defining an `add` method allows instances to be combined with the `+` operator:

```rust
struct Vec2 {
    x, y

    fn add(self, other) {
        Vec2(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
    }
}

let a = Vec2(1, 2);
let b = Vec2(3, 4);
let c = a + b;
print(c.x, c.y);
```

Output:

```
4 6
```

### Struct Introspection

Every struct definition has a `__name__` attribute. Instances have a `__type__`
attribute that refers back to the struct definition:

```rust
struct Animal {
    name,
    age
}

print(Animal.__name__);

let dog = Animal("Buddy", 5);
print(dog.__type__.__name__);
```

Output:

```
Animal
Animal
```

## String Interpolation

Expressions can be embedded in strings using `\(expr)` syntax:

```rust
let name = "World";
let msg = "Hello, \(name)!";
print(msg);
```

Output:

```
Hello, World!
```

Arbitrary expressions are supported, including function calls and nested
interpolation:

```rust
let result = "2 + 3 = \(2 + 3)";
print(result);
```

Output:

```
2 + 3 = 5
```

```rust
fn greet(name) {
    "hello \(name)"
}
print("You say: '\(greet("Alice"))' to me");
```

Output:

```
You say: 'hello Alice' to me
```

## Block Expressions

Curly braces create block expressions. The value of the last expression in a
block becomes the block's value:

```rust
let result = {
    let a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    a + b
};
print(result);
```

Output:

```
30
```

This works with `if`/`else` to create conditional expressions:

```rust
let x = 10;
let label = if x > 5 { "big" } else { "small" };
print(label);
```

Output:

```
big
```

## Comments

Single-line comments start with `//`:

```rust
// This is a comment
let x = 42;
print(x);
```

Output:

```
42
```

Multi-line comments use `/* */` and can be nested:

```rust
/* This is a
   multi-line comment */
let x = 42;

/* outer /* inner comment */ still a comment */
print(x);
```

Output:

```
42
```

## Custom Iterators

Any struct that implements an `iter` method returning an object with a `next`
method can be used in `for` loops. The `next` method should return `None` to
signal the end of iteration:

```rust
struct Counter {
    current,
    max,

    fn iter(self) {
        self
    }

    fn next(self) {
        if self.current >= self.max {
            return None;
        }
        let val = self.current;
        self.current = self.current + 1;
        return val;
    }
}

for i in Counter(0, 3) {
    print(i);
}
```

Output:

```
0
1
2
```

## Built-in Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `print(args...)` | Prints arguments separated by spaces, followed by a newline |
| `assert(condition)` | Panics if `condition` is falsy |
| `panic(message)` | Immediately halts execution with an error message |
| `dict()` | Creates a new empty dictionary |
| `Range(start, end)` | Creates a range from `start` (inclusive) to `end` (exclusive) |
| `str(value)` | Converts a value to a string |
| `int(value)` | Converts a value to an integer (panics on failure) |
| `float(value)` | Converts a value to a float (panics on failure) |
| `try_int(value)` | Converts a value to an integer, returns `None` on failure |
| `try_float(value)` | Converts a value to a float, returns `None` on failure |

Type conversion examples:

```rust
print(int("42"));
print(float("3.14"));
print(str(123));
```

Output:

```
42
3.14
123
```

The `try_` variants return `None` instead of panicking on invalid input:

```rust
let good = try_int("42");
print(good);
let bad = try_int("hello");
print(bad);
```

Output:

```
42
None
```

## Error Handling Philosophy

Shimlang intentionally does not include a `try`/`catch` mechanism. Exceptions
are not part of normal control flow. When an invalid operation occurs — such as
an out-of-bounds access, a failed type conversion, or a violated assertion — it
represents programmer error, not a recoverable condition.

The built-in `panic` function and `assert` halt execution immediately:

```rust
assert(1 == 1);   // passes silently
assert(1 == 2);   // halts with an error

panic("something went wrong");  // always halts
```

For operations that might legitimately fail with user-supplied data, Shimlang
provides `try_` variants that return `None` instead of panicking:

```rust
let n = try_int("not a number");
if n == None {
    print("invalid input");
}
```

Output:

```
invalid input
```

Rather than adding exception handling, the plan is to introduce a
**time-travelling debugger with hot reloading** that automatically opens a
debugger at the offending line during development. This means that when a panic
occurs, the developer can inspect the full program state, step backward through
execution, fix the code, and resume — without restarting the program. GDScript
takes a similar approach by treating errors as signals for the development
environment rather than conditions to catch at runtime.

## Suggested Improvements

The following changes would improve the Shimlang experience for users:

- **Inequality operator (`!=`):** The `!=` token is defined internally but
  not yet wired into the lexer. Currently the only way to test inequality is
  `!(a == b)`, which is less readable than `a != b`.
- **Compound assignment operators:** `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `/=` would reduce
  boilerplate in expressions like `count = count + 1`.
- **Else-if chains (`else if`):** Currently each `else if` requires nested
  braces. A dedicated `else if` syntax would flatten conditional chains.
- **Error handling:** The absence of `try`/`catch` is a deliberate design
  choice (see [Error Handling Philosophy](#error-handling-philosophy)). Future
  work in this area focuses on the time-travelling debugger and expanding the
  set of `try_` variants for operations that can fail with user-supplied data.
- **Module / import system:** All code lives in a single file. An import
  system would allow organizing projects into reusable modules.
- **Tuple type and destructuring:** Tuples and pattern-matching destructuring
  (e.g., `let (x, y) = point;`) would make working with multiple return values
  more ergonomic.
- **Variadic arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`):** Functions cannot currently
  accept a variable number of positional or keyword arguments.
- **Standard library expansion:** Built-in support for file I/O, math
  functions (e.g., `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`), and string manipulation methods
  (e.g., `split`, `join`, `trim`, `upper`, `lower`) would greatly increase the
  language's utility.
- **REPL improvements:** The interactive REPL could benefit from line editing,
  history, and multi-line input support.
- **Better error messages:** While error messages include source location,
  they could be improved with suggestions, "did you mean?" hints, and
  stack traces for runtime errors in nested function calls.
