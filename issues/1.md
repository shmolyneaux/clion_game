### Title
Add CreateStruct formatting to format_asm function

### Description
The `format_asm` function in `shimlang/src/lib.rs` is missing a handler for the `ByteCode::CreateStruct` instruction, which is a complex multi-byte instruction that defines struct types. Without proper formatting, these instructions appear as raw numbers making bytecode difficult to read.

### Current Behavior
CreateStruct instructions are not properly formatted in the decompilation output, despite being one of the most complex bytecode instructions.

### Proposed Improvement
Add a handler for CreateStruct that parses and displays the struct definition information:

```rust
} else if *b == ByteCode::CreateStruct as u8 {
    let struct_size = ((bytes[idx + 1] as usize) << 8) + bytes[idx + 2] as usize;
    let member_count = bytes[idx + 3];
    let method_count = bytes[idx + 4];
    
    // Read struct name
    let name_len = bytes[idx + 5];
    let name = &bytes[idx + 6..idx + 6 + name_len as usize];
    
    out.push_str(&format!("CreateStruct \"{}\" members={} methods={} size={}", 
                          debug_u8s(name), member_count, method_count, struct_size));
    
    // Skip to the end of the struct definition
    // Note: The outer loop will add 1, so we subtract 1 here
    idx += struct_size - 1;
}
```

### Reference Implementation
The bytecode execution handler (around line 6735 in `shimlang/src/lib.rs`) shows the complete struct creation logic with member and method parsing.

### Considerations
- CreateStruct is a variable-length instruction with embedded member names and method offsets
- The struct size is encoded in bytes 1-2 and includes all the struct metadata
- Optionally, could show member and method names if we parse deeper into the structure
- Need to ensure `idx` correctly jumps to the end of the entire struct definition

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add CreateStruct handler to `format_asm` function
- [ ] Display struct name, member count, method count, and size
- [ ] Correctly consume all bytes in the struct definition
- [ ] Ensure all tests in `test_shimlang.py` continue to pass
- [ ] Update any `.stdout` files in `test_scripts/decompile/` that need to reflect the new output format
