# SHIM Engine

The Shim Engine is a prototype game engine focused on quickly iterating on 3D games.

The interface is heavily influenced by the LÃ–VE game framework in terms of its
simplicity and easy-of-use. It expands on this with powerful time-travelling debugging,
data inspection, hot reloading, and deterministic replays.

Should include mesh/texture/audio authoring within the editor.
